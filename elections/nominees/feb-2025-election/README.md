# How to Nominate a Candidate

To nominate a candidate, create a single markdown file titled "[candidate-name].md" with the name of the candidate as the file name (with spaces replaced by dashes). See [sample-nomination.md](/elections/nominees/feb-2025-election/sample-nomination.md) for a template to follow. Submit this PR, and the TSC will review and approve the PR (or leave comments on why the PR will not be accepted).
